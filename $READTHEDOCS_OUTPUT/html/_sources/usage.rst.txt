**Usage** 
============

The board ships with everything ready to go - preloaded with firmware to start flashing right away.  Even the microSD card is preloaded with bin files for trigBoard release (11/29/21)

**Board Power**
------------------
   Can just connect a micro USB cable to the board or a 4.2V lithium battery (CHECK POLARITY), any of the `adafruit batteries <https://www.adafruit.com/product/258>`_ will work.  Note that the board can also charge the battery - the charge LED indicates status red-charging, green-complete

**Target Power**
   The board has a PH-2 JST connector that can be used to power the target ESP32.  There are 4 power sources for this connector selected by jumper:

* 3.0V is a switched power source that the board can turn on/off on-demand.  Very useful for power cycling the target and since it's 3.0V, can be used for calibration.  **RECCOMENDED**
* 5V always on from USB, or boosted if running on battery
* 3.3V always on
* VBAT is the raw battery voltage

**Files**
-----------------

   When you upload from the Arduino IDE, it flashes x4 bin files.  One of these is the actual firmware, while the other 3 are mostly going to be the same for most applications.  You can use the stock files that are on the microSD card, and only replace this file: 

.. image:: images/filetoreplace.png
   :align: center

You can generate this file yourself by "Export Compile Binary" from the Arduino IDE:

.. image:: images/exportcompilebinary.png
   :align: center

The ESPprogrammer will automatically find all of these files by their names, so don't worry about renaming.  
   This is how it finds these files:

.. code-block:: C

   const char bootKey[] = "boot_app";
   const char bootloaderKey[] = "bootloader";
   const char partitionsKey[] = "partitions";
   const char firmwareKey[] = ".ino.bin";//when you flash over USB, it looks like this
   const char firmwareSecondKey[] = "esp32.bin";//when you export compiled binary, this is the file it generates

Those other three bin files can also be updated, since these are generated when their are updates to the ESP32 core or if any of the board settings are changed.  From the IDE, make sure Verbose output is enabled, then when you try to upload via USB (even if a board isn't connected), you want to copy this last command out: 

.. image:: images/compiledcomandline.png
   :align: center

Paste that into text editor and you'll see the paths to all 4 bin files:

.. image:: images/flashingpaths.png
   :align: center

You can navigate to these folders and **COPY** them to the microSD card.  

**NEW FOR BOARDS SHIPPED AFTER NOV 2023** There is now a **config.txt** file on the sd card that can be used to set the programming offsets to anything you want. Useful for programming different variants of the ESP32, like the S3, C3, etc..  This file is very sensitive to spaces and formatting, so be careful when changing this.

Here is an example for an ESP32

.. code-block:: C

   bootNameOffset=0xe000
   bootloaderNameOffset=0x1000
   partitionsNameOffset=0x8000
   firmwareNameOffset=0x10000
   spiffsNameOffset=0x3D0000

Here is an example for an ESP32-S3

.. code-block:: C

   bootNameOffset=0xe000
   bootloaderNameOffset=0x0
   partitionsNameOffset=0x8000
   firmwareNameOffset=0x10000
   spiffsNameOffset=0x10000


**THIS IS JUST HERE FOR REFERENCE, but all boards shipped before Oct 2023, have the these offsets hard coded**
Also, note the offsets above. These can change depending on your partition scheme, so double check your settings and note that you may have to also change the ESP programmer code. ***THE PARTITON SCHEME USED HERE IS "Minimal SPIFFS(1.9MB APP with OTA/190KB SPIFFS)"***

.. image:: images/flashingStartOffset.png
   :align: center

**Connections**
--------------------

**All signals are 3.3V! regardless of target power setting**

The female 1x6 connector follows a standard FTDI pinout, where the DTR pin is controlled by the board to trigger the auto-reset circuit, but if your target board doesn't have an auto-reset circuit, then you'll have to toggle reset/gpio0 on the target to place in download mode. The other way that I've tested the board with targets that don't support an auto reset circuit is to let programmer just cycle power, and connect the DTR pin to the Boot pin on the target - tested this on ESP32-S3 and -C3 customer boards.  Just note that this is with the jumper in the 3V position since this is the "switched" power from the programmer.   

The 2x6 was intended to be used with `Tag Connect Cables <https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2030-idc-nl>`_

You'll notice that even the programmer board uses this style interface, so technically programmer board can upload to another programmer board!!

**Flashing**
-------------------------

- Files loaded on microSD card?
- Target Power set?
- Target board connected?
- Programmer board has power?
- Slide the switch to ON, wait for GREEN LED? 
- PRESS Green Button, and should see the YELLOW LED start flashing, when you see the GREEN LED flash, then you know everything is working. Eventually, you'll see the only the GREEN LED flash, and you're done!  

NOTE: If you see the RED LED turn on, this means something went wrong and will have press the RESET button to start over. You can connect to the HOST Programming port with a USB-Serial converter to debug what went wrong.

**Clone Board/Copy SPIFFS**
-----------------------------

A lot of ESP32 projects will use SPIFFS to store various settings/parameters.  All customizable features in the trigBoard are stored in SPIFFS, so if you had one "golden" board that you had setup (WiFi/Push Notification Settings/etc), then you can also create a separate bin file that contains this information as well.  Otherwise, when you flash only the 4 files as described above, the SPIFFS remains as-is.  So if you're flashing a fresh device, the SPIFFS will be blank.... or maybe you want to erase the SPIFFS as well?  This is possible with this same technique.  

**STEP 1 - READ FROM GOLDEN BOARD** You will need to use the command line/terminal with a USB-Serial converter connected to the "Golden" ESP32.  Will be using MacOS for this walkthrough, though should be similar on Windows.  

Fastest way to get going with this is to use the Arduino IDE as if you're programming an ESP32.  Connect the USB-Serial converter, choose the com port, and **without** the ESP32 connected, try uploading a blank sketch.  **It will obviously fail** but this is what we want.  Now you can copy out the command used to flash the board:

.. image:: images/compiledcomandline.png
   :align: center

We're not going to flash, but instead, we're going to read the flash. This sets up the command for us, so you'll start with something like this from the Arduino IDE::

/Users/kevindarrah/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/3.0.0/esptool --chip esp32 --port /dev/cu.usbserial-DA00XJ7V --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size detect 0xe000 /Users/kevindarrah/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/1.0.6/tools/partitions/boot_app0.bin 0x1000 /Users/kevindarrah/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/1.0.6/tools/sdk/bin/bootloader_qio_80m.bin 0x10000 /var/folders/gv/dqd77lfs72xgzhcbwrp3f6vc0000gn/T/arduino_build_3054/sketch_feb27a.ino.bin 0x8000 /var/folders/gv/dqd77lfs72xgzhcbwrp3f6vc0000gn/T/arduino_build_3054/sketch_feb27a.ino.partitions.bin

Let's change that to this::

/Users/kevindarrah/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/3.0.0/esptool --chip esp32 --port /dev/cu.usbserial-DA00XJ7V --baud 230400 read_flash 0x3D0000 0x30000 spiffs.bin


Couple things I changed there: 
   - Slowed the baud rate slightly for reading - this has just been more reliable for me
   - The command is now read_flash
   - The 0x3D0000 in there is the offset for the SPIFFS **Based on your partition scheme** In my case, again I used "Minimal SPIFFS... "  But if you change this, you can look it up `here <https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/tools/partitions>`_
   - The second number there 0x30000 is the size, which is also defined by the partition table.

   For example, when you pull up the ***min_spiffs.csv*** from that link, you can see the two numbers you'll need for this scheme: 

.. image:: images/compiledcomandline.png
   :align: center

|  - That "spiffs.bin" is file name for the bin file you will create. I didn't give this a path, so it just ends up here on my machine: /Users/kevindarrah/spiffs.bin

What if you want to erase the SPIFFS?  Well, just run this command before you read the flash::

   /Users/kevindarrah/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esptool_py/3.0.0/esptool --chip esp32 --port /dev/cu.usbserial-DA00XJ7V erase_flash

Now you have an easy way for the programmer board to erase the SPIFFS as well if you want as well.  

**STEP 2 SETUP PROGRAMMER BOARD**

The latest ESPprogrammer code supports SPIFFS programming as well, so if it finds a file on the sd card "spiffs.bin", then it will use that to flash the SPIFFS with this file.  Otherwise, will only flash the 4 required files.  

.. image:: images/spiffsbinfile.png
   :align: center

**NOTE**,just like the other 4 files, the offset in the code must match the partition scheme used, so you may have to change this code for your programmer:

.. image:: images/spiffsoffetincode.png
   :align: center

So if you're also using the minimal SPIFFS scheme, then just copy the spiffs.bin file to the sd card and you're good to go.  

**STEP 3 Calibration**

The trigBoard also stores a factory calibration constant for the battery voltage measurement, so if you copy the SPIFFS from one trigBoard to another, you will also be copying the **WRONG** constant.  No big deal though, you'll just need to recalibrate the new board.  Luckily, the programmer board provides an accurate 3V source, so if you have the jumper set to 3V and you're power the board from this source, then just launch the configurator, scroll all the way down and make sure the calibration constant is set to 0.  Then you can scroll back up and see the difference away from 3.0V the board is.  Like if you see 3.5V, scroll back down and set the calibration to -0.5.  Simple as that!
